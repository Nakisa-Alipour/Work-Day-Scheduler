# Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The application uses the Day.js library to work with date and time. Please read the documentation carefully and focus on using Day.js in the browser.

## User Story

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.


## Acceptance Criteria

Given I am using a daily planner to create a schedule:

When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
When I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
When I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event.
When I click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
When I refresh the page, the saved events persist.



## Getting Started

To use this application, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. The application will run in the browser.

## Usage

To use the Work Day Scheduler, simply click on a timeblock to enter an event. Once you have entered an event, click the save button to save it. The application will automatically save your events to local storage, so you can refresh the page and your events will still be there.

The timeblocks are color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green). This allows you to quickly see which events are coming up and which ones you may have missed.
